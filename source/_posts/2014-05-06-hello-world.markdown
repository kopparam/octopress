Have you ever been in a situation where you are trying to do/fix/build/break something, and you are blocked by that something not working?

That is where blogs save the world, no documentaion can be exaustive and going through long threads in forums can be a pain. Blogs however are written by people who have been in the same painful situation and who do not want others to go through the same. This is exactly why I'm starting this blog. Also, it serves as a journal of sorts. This blog will mainly be technical and a few fun stuff every now and then.

It was back in high school when I first got a taste for technolgy in general and soon enough I fell in love with coding. You might be wonderning why I have taken so long to start blogging especially that I'm a tech guy. Well, I never had an "Ungooglable" situation till recent times when I finaly have caught up to the latest technologies where everything won't go as smoothly as expected.
