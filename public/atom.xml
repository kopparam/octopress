    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Horizon is a web based user interface to manage Openstack services like Nova, Neutron, Glance, etc. It was Canonical who went ahead and implemented this from Openstack&rsquo;s Dashboard. It is a Django-based project which builds on a Django site which uses <code>dashboard</code> to communicate with the Openstack services. My goal here was to customize it to put in my own logo.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Follow the Docs</h2>

<p>I have never worked on Django framework so I intuitively started looking at the docs to give me pointers to where to look for the css which linked to the logo image file. I first looked <a href="http://docs.openstack.org/havana/config-reference/content/dashboard-custom-brand.html">here</a>, but realized that this was the original <strong>Dashboard</strong> and not the Canonical&rsquo;s Horizon that was working with. Well, it&rsquo;s a shame that I had to put in the raged comment there. But, it is really very easy to get that page confused with Horizon.</p>

<p>A little more looking at I found <a href="http://docs.openstack.org/developer/horizon/topics/customizing.html">this</a>. It clearly says Horizon, so looks like we are going somewhere now. But I just could not find the file:<code>openstack_dashboard/local/local_settings.py</code> in the very first instruction which can change the page title.</p>

<h2>Why are you doing this to me?</h2>

<p>After being disheartened by not able to find the file, I read on. Oh! there is a file location specified for something else, maybe it&rsquo;s there. The <code>local_setting.py</code> is in <code>/usr/share/openstack-dashboard/openstack_dashboard/local/local_settings.py</code>. Just include a line to get a custom page title <code>SITE_BRANDING="This is my Openstack"</code> in that file.</p>

<p>Now, I wanted to replace the OpenStack logo which appears when I login and after the login in my dashboard with my own logo. The next section in the <a href="http://docs.openstack.org/developer/horizon/topics/customizing.html">document</a> gives me instructions for exactly that. I just had to replace the image file at <code>/usr/share/openstack-dashboard/openstack_dashboard/static/dashboard/img/logo.png.</code> But, I dont see what I&rsquo;m supposed to see. The old image is still there.</p>

<h2>Inspect element</h2>

<p>At this point of time, I&rsquo;m questioning the effectiveness of the documentation. I close the document. And open up Chrome and use the developer tools on the dashboard. I find some weird hexa after the url <code>url('/static/dashboard/img/logo-splash.png?bd0a834bae0e')</code>. And I soon realize that this css is in <code>/usr/share/openstack-dashboard/static/dashboard/css</code>. And it has been relatively referencing to the <code>img</code> directory. That is not where I put my logo.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s done is done. So, I replace <code>logo-splash.png</code> and <code>logo.png</code> in the <code>/usr/share/openstack-dashboard/static/dashboard/img</code> directory. And finally I have my logo show up at the login screen. But, the old Openstack logo shows up after you login.</p>

<p>I dive right into the css remove the funny hexa on the url. And edit a little css to get my logo to look nice here. Looks like Horizon uses a css compressor to make your pages load faster. I have never used one and do not know how they work. So to get your logo at the dashboard edit the css file <code>/usr/share/openstack-dashboard/static/dashboard/css/291184af72d2.css</code> (it might be different name for you)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To develop something, having a proper environment setup is key. This post explains how you can set up a development environment to contribute to OpenStack. I&rsquo;m going to use DevStack which is a shell script that builds OpenStack completely in a developer friendly environment.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Virtual Machine</h2>

<p>Firstly, set up a virtual machine running any of the supported distro/release of DevStack. Ubuntu 12.04, Fedora 20, CentOS/RHEL 6.5 are supported. Any type of virtualisation software should be fine, I use Vagrant because it is easier to manage the instances.
After a VM is up and running, install a Linux distribution. I have installed Ubuntu 14.04 (it is not officially supported, but it works just fine).</p>

<h2>Setup user</h2>

<p>At this point, we have a VM running a Linux OS. We need to create a user called <em>stack</em>. For Red Hat and the like, <em>stack</em> should be a non-root user, this does not matter in Ubuntu.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo adduser stack
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo adduser stack sudo <span class="c"># only for Ubuntu if you need stack to be a sudoer</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Setup the VM</h2>

<p>We need to install git and clone the DevStack repository</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo apt-get update
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo apt-get install git
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> ~
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>git clone https://github.com/openstack-dev/devstack.git
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Now is the fun part, well almost</h2>

<p>Working with OpenStack means you got to remember passwords for admin, database, rabbit etc. Your life is a lot simpler with a bit of configuration. Edit the local.conf file in the repository&rsquo;s root to look like this.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="o">[[</span><span class="nb">local</span>|localrc<span class="o">]]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">ADMIN_PASSWORD</span><span class="o">=</span>secrete
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">DATABASE_PASSWORD</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$ADMIN_PASSWORD</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">RABBIT_PASSWORD</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$ADMIN_PASSWORD</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">SERVICE_PASSWORD</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$ADMIN_PASSWORD</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">SERVICE_TOKEN</span><span class="o">=</span>some_token
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Ok, the fun part</h2>

<p>Simply run stack.sh and keep your eyes peeled</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>./stack.sh
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Using DevStack</h2>

<p>stack.sh takes a long time to execute. After it has completed successfully, it displays information about your newly chromed OpenStack install. You can log in to Horizon, which is the web UI dashboard to manage your VMs.
Be careful when you reboot your VM. If you ever need to reboot, you have to run unstack.sh and then reboot. After the reboot you need to run rejoin-stack.sh to get the services running again.</p>

<h2>Other stuff</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s face it. It is impossible to keep up with the output that <em>stack.sh</em> throws at you. We&rsquo;ll need to edit the <code>local.conf</code> file to log it by setting <code>LOGFILE</code>. DevStack runs all OpenStack services on a screen session. To log this screen we can set the <code>SCREEN_LOGDIR</code> variable.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">LOGFILE</span><span class="o">=</span>/opt/stack/logs/stack.sh.log
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">VERBOSE</span><span class="o">=</span>True
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">LOG_COLOR</span><span class="o">=</span>True
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">SCREEN_LOGDIR</span><span class="o">=</span>/opt/stack/logs
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Enjoy your OpenStack and please contribute to the OpenSource community.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>That is where blogs save the world, no documentaion can be exaustive and going through long threads in forums can be a pain. Blogs however are written by people who have been in the same painful situation and who do not want others to go through the same. This is exactly why I&rsquo;m starting this blog. Also, it serves as a journal of sorts. This blog will mainly be technical and a few fun stuff every now and then.</p>

<p>It was back in high school when I first got a taste for technolgy in general and soon enough I fell in love with coding. You might be wonderning why I have taken so long to start blogging especially that I&rsquo;m a tech guy. Well, I never had an &ldquo;Ungooglable&rdquo; situation till recent times when I finaly have caught up to the latest technologies where everything won&rsquo;t go as smoothly as expected.</p>
